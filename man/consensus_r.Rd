\title{Calculate consensus segments from a list of segmentation breakpoints}
\usage{
consensus_r(b, n, w, aeh = function(L) L^2/2, store = FALSE,
  test = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{b}{list of breakpoints of different segmentations}

\item{n}{total sequence length (\code{max(b)} if not provided)}

\item{w}{weights vector, must sum up to 1 or will be normalized}

\item{store}{for debugging: store and return all internal vectors}

\item{test}{for debugging: compare the incrementally calculated
Delta with the very slow direct calculation}

\item{e}{potential function, taking one argument: the length \code{L}
of the evaluated interval}
}
